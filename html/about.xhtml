                <p>There's the famous saying, "fame changes people", and for our team we wanted to explore it literally. How did fame change these artists’ approach to their music, if at all? Were these positive or negative changes? What did fame bring into their lives?
                    
                    For our project we analyzed songs from the beginning of artists’ careers and how they compared to the music they release now. We focused on how the topics of their lyrics changed as well as the tone and mood of their songs.
                    
                    Research question: How did the topics of hip hop artists’ music change as their career progressed?
