        <line>Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat</line>

            <line>Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership</line>
            <line>But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership</line>
            <line>That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it</line>
            <line>Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it</line>
            <line>But I know they don't want me in the damn club</line>
            <line>They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club</line>
            <line>I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed</line>
            <line>Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times</line>
            <line>But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid</line>
            <line>It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved</line>

        <line>We are all here for a reason on a particular path</line>
        <line>You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math</line>
        <line>Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious</line>
        <line>That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world</line>
        <line>I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls</line>
        <line>I'm not just another individual</line>
        <line>My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual</line>
        <line>But I get my hymns from Him</line>
        <line>So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical</line>
        <line>I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument</line>
        <line>My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes</line>
        <line>For your soul and your mental</line>
        <line>That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into</line>
        <line>Yeah I need my loot by rent day</line>
        <line>But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte</line>
        <line>I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque</line>
        <line>I can't stop, that's why I'm hot</line>
        <line>Determination, dedication, motivation</line>
        <line>I'm talking to you of my many inspirations</line>
        <line>When I say I can't let you or self-down</line>
        <line>If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff</line>
        <line>And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life</line>
        <line>In my grip, I would never ever let you down</line>
        <line>And when these words are found</line>
        <line>Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed</line>
        <line>With a language called love</line>
        <line>That's why my breath is felt by the deaf</line>
        <line>And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind</line>
        <line>I too dream in color and in rhyme</line>
        <line>So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house</line>
        <line>'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth</line>
        <line>A touch of God reigns out</line>
        <line>Take 'em to church</line>

        <line>Who else you know been hot this long?</line>
        <line>(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)</line>
        <line>Started from nothing but he got this strong</line>
        <line>(The Roc is in the building)</line>
        <line>Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you</line>
        <line>Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)</line>
        <line>Let you tell it, man, I'm falling</line>
        <line>Well, somebody must have caught him</line>
        <line>'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them</line>
        <line>Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them</line>
        <line>More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way</line>
        <line>Clear the way, I'm here to stay</line>
        <line>Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that</line>
        <line>This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced</line>
        <line>When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious</line>
        <line>Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'</line>
        <line>Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas</line>
        <line>The way y'all all follow Jigga</line>
        <line>Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why</line>
        <line>Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive</line>
