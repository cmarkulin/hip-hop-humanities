[Intro: Kanye West]
For all my people that's—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tеll my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on wеlfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is for all my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause they need a extra scratch just so they can shine
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We steal money out the register for extra scratch, then get paid
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
[Verse 3: GLC]
And now they got me doing bug-stained flow
Way over gold, like my pockets working out
Calls stay over swole poles
Crazy over hoes, flow all up in your nose
At night, I cook coke, smell all up in your clothes
I would use hotplates mane, rarely over stoves
When momma got up on her feet, got heat, never froze
By the time I'm 24, I was back over stoves
Less than a year ago, it was something wonderful
Daddy broke over dro, tryna get them 100 spokes
Smokers up in our hood, watch us weekly overdose
Homies got shot in the head, bled, strictly over-tote
Your folks would stab your back then homies would cut your throat
No, [?], hoe, to see tomorrow
87 would swallow hollow tips, never borrowed
Bitch, you gotta honour the way that I live
A product of my environment, don't trifle me
Kids, c'mon

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
