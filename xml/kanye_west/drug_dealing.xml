        <line>If this is your first time hearing this</line>
        <line>You are about to experience something so cold, man</line>
        <line>We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted</line>
        <line>Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man</line>
        <line>But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man</line>
        <line>Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man</line>
        <line>Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man</line>
        <line>We don't care what people say</line>
        <line>This is for my niggas outside all winter</line>
        <line>'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna..."</line>
        <line>Sitting in the hood like community colleges</line>
        <topic type="family"><line>This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship</line></topic>
        <line>'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition</line>
        <line>And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home</line>
        <line>So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job</line>
        <line>You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown</line>

        <line>It's bad enough we on welfare</line>
        <line>They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair</line>
        <line>I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here</line>
        <line>They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here</line>
        <line>Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us</line>
        <line>When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance</line>
