        <line>What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr</line>
        <line>First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval
            Office</line>
        <line>You might not have been the only one that could've did that</line>
        <line>But you were the one that did do that</line>
        <line>And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this
            fight</line>
        <line>You know, to me, it kinda feels like</line>
        <line>Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids</line>
        <line>Have all been incarcerated through this journey</line>
        <line>And we haven't even been to jail</line>
        <line>We have been looked at and treated as criminals</line>
        <line>For being a part of this family</line>
        <line>My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in</line>
        <line>Is that he wanted to make a change in this community <background>Tell me if you know
                someone that needs</background></line>
        <line>'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him</line>
        <line>And it is what made the children of today</line>
        <line>After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one</line>
        <line>My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons
            in the world</line>
        <line>And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples</line>
        <line>If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction</line>
        <line>Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years</line>
        <line>Man, he would be dead to me</line>
        <line>I didn't sign up for that</line>
        <line>I didn't stay on this journey this long for that</line>
        <line>All my life, man</line>
        <line>I've been waitin' for my father to come home</line>
        <line>They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home</line>
        <line>Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home</line>
        <line>I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home</line>
        <line>Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated</line>
        <line>He still not home</line>
        <line>Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'</line>
        <line>Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren</line>
        <line>And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather</line>
        <line>Even though it is not seen that way for some of us</line>
        <line>But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community</line>
        <line>Who deserves to breathe free air</line>
        <line>Free my father <background>Jesus</background>, Mr. Larry Hoover Sr.
