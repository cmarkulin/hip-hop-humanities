<verse vocals="J_Cole" mood="energetic" tone="positive">
<line>Uh, applying pressure</line>
<line>Started my grind where crime festers</line>
<line>And nines showing like they in they second trimesters <background>Pregnant</background></line>
<line>That’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online, I pay no mind to their benign gesturеs <background>Mm</background></line>
<line>Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things, to say thе least</line>
<line>My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East <background>What up, East?</background></line>
<line>Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets</line>
<line>These niggas' whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease <background>Uh</background></line>
<line>Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to <background>I understand that</background></line>
<topic type="poverty"><line>Instead of cappin', why don’t you talk about being a broke rapper? <background>I don’t understand that</background></line></topic>
<line>That's a perspective I respect because it’s real</line>
<topic type="poverty"><line>What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills</line></topic>
<topic type="money"><line>That was me in '08, seein' no cake</line></topic>
<line>Not even on dates I celebrated my birth</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Just did the mental math and calculated my worth</line></topic>
<line>Shit crazy, didn’t know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video <background>I'm the real Shady</background></line>
<line>Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo</line>
<line>Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe</line>
<line>'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles</line>
<line>Just projectiles from niggas salty, you rockin' the fresher textiles</line>
<line>I seen best pals grow up and switch <background>I hate to see it</background></line>
<topic type="money"><line>Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch <background>Ah, I hate to see it</background></line></topic>
<line>I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch</line>
<topic type="wealth"><line>But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich</line></topic>
<line>Envy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you</line>
<topic type="poverty"><line>If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you</line></topic>
<topic type="money"><line>Money ain't everything, I never say that <background>Never</background></line></topic>
<line>But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell they soul to get wherever they at <background>Come on, man</background></line>
<line>Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga <background>Come on, nigga</background></line>
</verse>
    
<outro vocals="J_Cole" mood="apathetic" tone="negative">
<line>Hell yeah <background>Ooh</background></line>
<line>Fuck, you know what it is, nigga</line>
<line>Don't even dare</line>
<line>Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch</line>
<line>That's why I gotta flex sometimes</line>
<line>'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga, like</line>
<line>Like you just really don't do it how you do it</line>
<line>Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do</line>
<line>Nigga look you dead in your face</line>
<line>And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it</line>
<line>That's why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face</line>
<line>So they know the difference between you, the real niggas, and the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man</line>
<line>Don't never get it fucked up</line>
<line>If a nigga can't do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever</line>
<line>"Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it and I'll never be able to do it like that"</line>
<line>Bitch, it's a difference <background>Ah</background></line>
<line><background>These are the same ones telling our people what we are and we aren't because we're just not working hard enough</background></line>
<line>And that mentality is what we're up against today</line>
<line>But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol</line>
<topic type="money"><line><background>You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there, we're coming to get that check</background></line></topic>
