<intro vocals="J_Cole" mood="sad" tone="negative">
<line>Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?</line>
<line>Which is more important?</line>

<chorus vocals="J_Cole" mood="sad" tone="negative">
<line>Everything come back around full circle</line>
<line>Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?</line>
<line>Everybody gotta cry once in a while</line>
<line>But how long will it take 'fore you smile?</line>
<line>This is that come-back-to-life shit</line>
<line>My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift</line>
<topic type="death"><line>And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon <background>Bitch, I'm back out...</background></line></topic>

<line>I brought him 'round close to me before but he</line>
<line>Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet</line>
<line>I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me</line>
<line>Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be</line>
<line>I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind</line>
<line>It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries</line>
<line>My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency</line>
<topic type="death"><line>Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see"</line></topic>
<line>Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me</line>
<line>Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back</line>
<line>Unfortunately we seen the trap</line>
<line>Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly</line>
<line>They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh</line>
