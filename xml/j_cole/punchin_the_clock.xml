<intro vocals="J_Cole Damian_Lillard" mood="determined" tone="negative">
<line>It ain't nothing I want more</line>
<line>Ain't nothing I want more</line>
<line>I ain't câ€“</line>
<line>I told you, when I first came here, I said, "I ain't come here to waste my time"</line>
<line>I came here</line>
<line>They gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for</line>
<line>And that's, that's what we here to do</line>
<line>Yeah, nigga, 26</line>
<line>The job still ain't done</line>
<line>Straight up</line>
<line>But I, I said, "You, you know what I'm here for"</line>
</intro>

<verse vocals="J_Cole" mood="cynical" tone="negative">
<line>Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity</line>
<line>I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity</line>
<line>Shit profound, we propagating more profanity</line>
<line>Paid off collections from recollections of calamity <background>Oh shit, look, that nigga gonna shoot</background></line>
<line>The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy <background>Oh shit, run, nigga, run</background></line>
<topic type="violence"><line>'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me</line></topic>
<line>Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss</line>
<topic type="religion"><line>Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity</line></topic>
<line>When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me <background>Jermaine</background></line>
<line>Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me</line>
<line>I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly</line></topic>
<line>Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family</line>
<line>Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me</line>
<line>Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me</line>
<line>Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me</line>
<line>Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off</line>
<line>Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact</line>
<line>Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back</line>
<line>Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity</line>
<line>Now that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me</line>
<line>All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you</line>
<line>Can't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly</line>
<line>All them niggas is so Kane, they started singin' like Danity</line>
<line>Now I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn</line>

<outro vocals="Damian_Lillard" mood="ambiguous" tone="neutral">
<line>A lot of times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes</line>
<line>In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and</line>
<line>With training and conditioning, and things like that</line>
<line>When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments</line>
<line>You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and</line>
<line>Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not</line>
<line>You know, it always come to light</line>
</outro>
