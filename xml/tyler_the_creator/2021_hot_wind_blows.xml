    <verse vocals="Tyler_the_Creator DJ_Drama" mood="confident" tone="positive">

<line>Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah</line>
<line>The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear (Woo)</line>
<line>So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair (Yeah)</line>

<line>We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah</line>
<line>Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again, we kissin', dawg</line>
<line>I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)</line>
        <topic type="wealth"><line>A hundred grand to sleep on the bird, the wings are whistlin' likeâ€”</line></topic>
<line>Man, they ain't listenin'</line>
<line>We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it</line>
<line>Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)</line>
<line>Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the sand</line>
<line>Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (True story)</line>

    <chorus vocals="Tyler_the_Creator DJ_Drama Lil_Wayne" mood="ambiguous" tone="neutral">
<line>(Hot wind)</line>
<line>Yeah, haha</line>
<line>You see these excursions right here?</line>
<line>Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)</line>
<line>Uh (Tunechi)</line>
    </chorus>

    <verse vocals="Lil_Wayne" mood="ambiguous" tone="neutral">
<line>Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me</line>
<line>Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef</line>
<line>And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat</line>
<line>Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me</line>
<line>From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering</line>
<line>I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet</line>
<line>The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me</line>
<line>Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now</line>
<line>Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns</line>
<line>I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out</line>
<line>And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow</line>
<line>And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)</line>
<line>I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', as cold as the devil and demon and ghost</line>
<line>I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow</line>
<line>Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the G.O.A.T.</line>
<line>The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat</line>
<line>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)</line>
    </verse>
    <outro vocals="DJ_Drama" mood="ambiguous" tone="neutral">
<line>(Hot wind)</line>
<line>(All aboard, nigga)</line>
<line>You see</line>
<line>We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake</line>
<line>Of course</line>
<line>Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'</line>
