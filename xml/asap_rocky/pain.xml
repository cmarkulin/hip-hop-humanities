[Intro]
Ahh, pain
Ahh, pain
Ahh, pain
Ahh

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around

[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Dead alive, it’s in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I’m a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah
[Verse 2: Kent Jamz]
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain’t got no cash
Bitch, hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue Foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the V.I.P
Bitch I’m hard and my loop concrete, too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take em from me

[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)

[Verse 3: Tube]
Tryna get on in this industry, acting like you're (Ruthy)
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT (oh yeah)
These male groupies doin' it however, whatever they seein' on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot, everybody's an artist (everybody not)
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars, getting change
In a minute I'ma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you have for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within
[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that Bathing Ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Li-life is what you need, won't you take a Z? Feel the breeze
Smoke the Sour Diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be, like? The Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, Hollywood, won’t you rest in peace?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around
