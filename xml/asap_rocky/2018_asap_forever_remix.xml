        <line>Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those</line>
        <line>Kids that ain't had someone on they own</line>
        <line>Hang on the words, you each have your song</line>
        <line>Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong</line>
        <line>Sing along, sing along, hmm</line>
