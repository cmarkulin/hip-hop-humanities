[Verse 1: DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, boom
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flowed ill, chromе stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines, chiefin'
Beefin', being off deep еnds, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin', "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates
[Interlude]
Three thousand years ago, Moses said:
"Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still a beast, not yet human!"

[Verse 2: DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcycle trunkfuls
From two-one two-one, lose crumbs to chunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans used to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel-head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing, twitching, kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch retirement, county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers!

[Outro]
DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
I need to use more power
