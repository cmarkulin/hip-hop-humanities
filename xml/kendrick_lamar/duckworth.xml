<intro vocals="Bēkon Kid_Capri" mood="sad" tone="negative">
<line>It was always me versus the world</line>
<line>Until I found it's me versus me</line>
<line>Why, why, why, why?</line>
<line>Why, why, why, why?</line>
<line>Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!</line>
<line>We gon' put it in reverse</line>
</intro>

<bridge vocals="Ted_Taylor" mood="null" tone="null">
<line>Darling, I told you many times</line>
<line>And I am telling you once again</line>
<line>Just to remind you, sweetheart</line>
<line>That my—</line>

<line>Oh, Lamar</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard</line></topic>
<topic type="religion"><line>Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark</line></topic>
<topic type="religion"><line>Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star</line></topic>
<line>Life is one funny ma'fucker</line>
<line>A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him</line>
<line>I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep</line>
<line>Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep</line>
<line>See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects</line>
<topic type="poverty"><line>The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect</line></topic>
<topic type="social_issues"><line>Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot</line></topic>
<topic type="social_issues"><line>Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals</line></topic>
<line>Anthony was the oldest of seven</line>
<line>Well-respected, calm and collected</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack</line></topic>
<line>A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her</line>
<topic type="family"><line>His family history: pimpin' and bangin'</line></topic>
<line>He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'</line>
<line>Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces</line>
<line>Even got some head from a smoker last weekend</line>
<line>Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie</line>
<line>Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily</line></topic>
<topic type="money"><line>Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies</line></topic>
<line>Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case</line>
<line>Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin</line></topic>
<line>He beat the case and went back to hustlin'</line>
<line>Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang</line>
<line>The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots</line>
<line>And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks</line>
<line>Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it</line>
<line>He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken</line>
<line>See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot</line>
<line>With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window</line>
<line>His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes</line>
<line>Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars</line></topic>
<line>They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college</line>
<line>Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it</line>
<line>Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends</line>
<line>Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket</line>
<line>'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it</line>
<line>Stuck up the place before, back in '84</line>
<line>That's when affiliation was really at gears of war</line>
<line>So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime</line>
<line>Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's</line>
<line>Ducky was well-aware</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year</line></topic>
<line>He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides</line>
<line>Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits</line>
<line>Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him</line>
<line>In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention</line>
<line>That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time</line>
<line>Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why</line>
<line>You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments</line>
<line>Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it</line>
<line>Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again</line>
<line>Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits</line>
<line>Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident</line>
<line>Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?</line>
<line>Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life</line>
<topic type="death"><line>While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight</line></topic>
