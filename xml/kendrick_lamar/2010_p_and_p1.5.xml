<line>Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs</line>
<line>Something to inspire me, rather than society's</line>
<line>Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love</line>
<line>I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Player's Club</line>
<line>I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05</line>
<line>That bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, I had no job</line>
<line>Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans</line>
<line>Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did</line>
<line>Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga</line>
<line>You gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga</line>
<topic type="death"><line>Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers</line></topic>
<line>Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover</line>
<topic type="poverty"><line>Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin</line></topic>
<line>Maintaining my modest— modest as I dream</line>
<line>So while I go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it</line>
<line>Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry</line>
<line><background>"Hey, what's up, daddy?"</background></line>

<bridge vocals="Kendrick_Lamar" mood="confident" tone="neutral">
<line>All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón</line>
<line>Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on</line>
<line>Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw</line>
<line>Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, "What it do?"</line>
<line>Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?</line>
<line>Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives</line>
<line>How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already</line>
<line>I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me</line>

<line>Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home</line>
<line>And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats</line>
<line>And it made me think if we could blink</line>
<line>To change locations where we at</line>
<topic type="social_issues"><line>We often get lost in the alcohol bottle</line></topic>
<line>In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow</line>
<line>Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit</line>
<line>Your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Two drugs, surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright</line></topic>
<line>But once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life</line>
<line>You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga</line>
<line>The antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga</line>
<line>But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her Zodiac sign</line>

<line>Okay, welcome to my diary—hmm, where should I begin?</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram</line></topic>
<line>Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them</line>
<line>One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me</line>
<line>And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man</line>
<line>What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it</line>
<line>Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open</line>
<line>Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open</line>
<line><background>Soul!</background> Balls deep, you dig?</line>
<line>Retrieve relief, you dig?</line>
<line>Let's kill a bottle of tequila</line>
<line>And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?</line>
<line>What's up?</line>
<line>I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck</line>
<line>Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day</line>
<line>'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day <background>Whole day, whole day</background></line>
