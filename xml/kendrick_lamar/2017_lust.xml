<line>I need some water</line>
<line>Something came over me</line>
<line>Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat</line>
<line>Too close to comfort</line>
<line>As blood rush my favorite vein</line>
<line>Heartbeat racing like a junkie's</line>
<line>I just need you to want me</line>
<line>Am I asking too much?</line>
<line>Let me put the head in</line>
<line>Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat</line>
<line>I promise, just a touch</line>
<line>Let me put the head in</line>
<line>If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"</line>

<line>I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night</line>
<line>Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life</line>
<line>Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30</line>
<line>Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change</line></topic>
<topic type="wealth"><line>Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain</line></topic>
<line>Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M</line>
<line>Take me a nap then do it again</line>
<line>We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news</line>
<line>Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true</line>
<line>All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep</line>
<line>None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap</line>
<line>Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—</line>
<line>Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly</line>
<line>Time passing, things change</line>
<line>Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways</line>
<line>Lust</line>

<line>Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame</line>
