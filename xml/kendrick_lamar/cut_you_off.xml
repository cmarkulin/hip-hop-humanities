<line>Uh, I'm tryna learn something new</line>
<line>I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar</line>
<topic type="religion"><line>I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God</line></topic>
<topic type="religion"><line>They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good</line></topic>
<line>Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock</line></topic>
<line>And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed</line>
<line>Like a small garage in your backyard</line>
<line>I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine</line>
<line>But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness</line>
<line>Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave</line></topic>
<line>Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys</line>
<line>To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who</line>
<line>And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves</line>
<line>But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off</line>
</verse>
    
<chorus vocals="Kendrick_Lamar" mood="apathetic" tone="negative">
<line>'Cause every time you come around</line>
<line>You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah</line>
<line>He say, she say, oh my God</line>
<line>Shut the fuck up... hoe</line>
<line>Every time you come around</line>
<line>You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah</line>
<line>He say, she say...</line>

<verse vocals="Kendrick_Lamar" mood="determined" tone="negative">
<line>Uh, I'm tryna learn something new</line>
<line>I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me</line>
<line>Or at least inquire similar desires</line>
<line>To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P</line>
<line>I'm talking ideas, motivation</line>
<line>It's more than making, enemies, my nigga</line>
<line>Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing</line>
<line>On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga</line>
<line>I function with you and you flaunt your pistol</line>
<line>Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo</line>
<line>Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend</line></topic>
<line>That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid</line></topic>
<line>Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style</line>
<line>Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off</line>

<line>Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?</line>
<topic type="violence"><line>I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?</line></topic>
<topic type="family"><line>See what I was taught, family is all I need</line></topic>

<line>Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in</line>
<topic type="death"><line>Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways</line></topic>
<line>Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison</line>
<line>For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms</line>
<topic type="family"><line>Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come</line></topic>

<interlude vocals="Kendrick_Lamar" mood="null" tone="neutral">
<line>What is HiiiPoWeR?</line>
<line>HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live</line>
<line>See it’s known today that the human race is nothing</line>
<line>No morals, no standards</line>
<line>What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations</line>
<topic type="money"><line>No, you don’t have to have a lot of money</line></topic>
<topic type="wealth"><line>You don’t have to be rich</line></topic>
<line>But you will be rich in mind and spirit</line>
<line>Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang</line>
<line>HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion</line>
