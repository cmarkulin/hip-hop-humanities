[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt, Navy Blue & Both]
True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pree the plot, you never seen me ghost
Uh, uh, see me ghost

[Verse: Navy Blue]
Know four years later, know I got better
Praise to my God, that armor all metal
Iron sword, know my spirits gon' get on, huh
I know my pops guilty 'cause he left 'em
I wore his blessings, honorary cloak
And sacred Yoruba is what he spoke
I pray I say goodbye but know I won't
At best, uh
'Cause if he live, he'd be a vegetable
Know he next to go
Had to show love, we had grown apart
Can't dwell on what it was
Singing from my heart Paloma is a dove

[Pre-Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Nah, true indeed, you never see the scope
Every which way the ouija go
Really nothing niggas ain't seen before
True indeed, true indeed, uh
[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt, Navy Blue & Both]
True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pree the plot, you never see me ghost
Uh, uh, see me ghost
