        <line>Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up</line>
        <line>Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front</line>
        <line>Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club</line>
        <line>Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life</line>
        <line>Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want</line>
        <line>18 years with a check coming every month</line>
        <line>Every step you take will get you closer to the paper</line>
        <line>Pay attention to the ones known</line>
        <line>The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward</line>
        <line>Fall with the rules to bask in the glory</line>
        <line>Bastard child often lost in the story</line>
        <line>Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win</line>

        <line>Say you love her, you losin'</line>
        <line>She don’t want him involved</line>
        <line>Keep your heart in your chest</line>
        <line>And your head in the stars</line>
        <line>Fall in love and get lost</line>
        <line>Fall in love and get lost</line>
        <line>Fall in love and get lost</line>

    <verse vocals="Vince Staples" mood="cynical" tone="negative">
        <line>He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw</line>
        <line>Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog</line>
        <line>How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague</line>
        <line>Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else</line>
        <line>The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it</line>
        <line>Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here</line>
        <line>Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is</line>
        <line>Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself</line>
        <line>Scared of the future, runnin' from the past</line>
        <line>Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass</line>
        <line>Young, dumb, and depraved, heart numb from the pain</line>
        <line>Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways</line>
