[Intro: Vince Staples]
(One, two, three, four) Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Three, four, one, two

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I don't wanna die, but I will for the cause (Dead homies)
Swallowing my pride like them pills y'all be off (Hell nah, yeah)
I hate when you high, but you hate feeling lost (Where we at with it?)
I hate every time that you ask, "Can we talk?" (Hell nah, yeah)
Tell me what I did now, drying off your tears now
Fighting for some years now, something gotta give (For real)
I don't wanna rebound, I just wanna sleep sound
Don't wanna dream 'bout the shit I done did (Walk 'em down)
You know these trips come with baggage (Yeah), been all 'cross this atlas
But keep coming back to this place 'cause they trapped us (The hood)
I preach what I practice, these streets all I know
And there's no place like home (No place like home, six-eight, yeah)

[Chorus: Fousheé]
Ooh (Alright, alright)
Take, take me home, like I clicked my shoes (Aw yeah, aw yeah)
I'm up, the price is sky-high (Sky-high)
Please save your two cents, I'm fine
I got no sensor, I vibe
Like, "Ooh, ah, ooh, ah"
Only abide by my rules
[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Yeah, I'm on PCH, going south, blower on the seat
With the windows down, music loud, let 'em hear the beat (Let 'em hear it now)
When it's quiet out, I hear the sound of those who rest in peace
Tryna drown the violence out (Dead homies), but let 'em say that they want beef
And we riding out, finding out where them niggas be (Where they be at with it?)
If they hanging out, lay 'em out, airing out the street (Knock 'em down)
Then it's out the way, out-of-state, please don't tell on me (PCH)
Don't need no more felonies (Please), all these broken memories (Please)
I be solo dolo, never know who working with police (Yeah)
When I hit the set, it's loaded; I don't know who envy me
I'm the only one who made it out—you remember me?
Is you a frenemy? You plan on killing me? No?

[Chorus: Fousheé]
Ooh (Alright, alright)
Take, take me home like I clicked my shoes (Aw yeah, aw yeah)
I'm up, the price is sky-high (Sky-high)
Please save your two cents, I'm fine
I got no sensor, I vibe
Like, "Ooh, ah, ooh, ah"
Only abide by my rules

[Outro: Fousheé]
Ooh (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
And I make mistakes sometimes
I
I tried
I can't tell you who's an ally
I can't tell you who
Who
