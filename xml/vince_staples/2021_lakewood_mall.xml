<line>Nigga met this nigga at the McDonald's at Lakewood Mall</line>
<line>This nigga like, randomly, like, "Bro, I got the Blue L.A.'s for your .38 Derringer"</line>
<line>Mind you nigga, this a— this a— you feel me?</line>
<line>It's the little pearl hammer handle thing, in and out</line>
<line>Nigga give it to him</line>
<line>Later on that night, nigga get pulled over</line>
<line>Police thoroughly searched the car</line>
<line>On God, nigga would've got cracked if I would've kept it</line>
<line>And they never even knew I got rid of the gun</line>
<line>I never told 'em, so the whole time they sеarching, everybody in the car is scarеd</line>
<line>I forgot to tell 'em, like, "Nigga been gave that shit away"</line>
<line>Then niggas go to this lil' party</line>
<line>Whatever the case, niggas like, "Fuck it, we ain't got nothin' to do, we gon' go"</line>
<line>Mind you, niggas ain't had shit to do all day</line>
<line>Niggas be getting robbed and some more shit, it's— it's wild</line>
<line>Vince like, "Nah, I'm cool"</line>
<line>Niggas go shake, go home</line>
<line>Later on that night, the homies, they get booked</line>
<line>Two bodies. Crazy—allegedly, though. Free Ty Bud</line>
<line>Moral of this whole story: Nigga gotta think ahead, which a nigga always has</line>
<line>You gotta separate yourself from bullshit (My world filled blue)</line>
<line>Can't get wrapped up in it (My life is blue)</line>
<line>And once again, it's still "Free Pac Slimm" 'til they free Pac Slimm</line>
