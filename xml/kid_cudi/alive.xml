        <line>I watch the sun collapse and took up in the clizzoud</line>
        <line>I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna</line>
        <line>Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight</line>
        <line>Even when I stray away, the light never left me</line>
        <line>Uh, I learn to follow my instinct</line>
        <line>Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil</line>
        <line>Feelin' out of place in a room full of people</line>
        <line>Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel</line>
        <line>Your fate will be</line>
