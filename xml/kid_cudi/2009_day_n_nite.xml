        <line>Day and night</line>
        <line>I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind</line>

        <line>What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play</line>
        <line>Now look at this</line>
        <line>Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me</line>
        <line>I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast</line>
        <line>I think I'm first but surely finish last, last</line>
