[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yo
Yo
Mmm
Ooh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Please, Lord, hear me now, hope you're listening
It's been centuries, least what it seems to me
I've been on this road, my eyes glistenin'
As I stare at Scott, I know he's all I got
Our pasts don't matter, babe, I'm much stronger
And fly much farther, soar overseas
Finally see, I'll keep on climbing
Ridin' the lightning and I am sure

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
But this is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
I've been goin', goin' in circles
Reoccurring dreams, talkin' in my sleep
Then I'm floatin' up to the surface
I can finally breathe, I could do anything
And I don't know why it's alright
And it's not at the same time
Then I look up at a blue sky
And I know
[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Phoebe Bridgers]
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
This is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Phoebe Bridgers]
Yo (Ah)
Yo (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, hmm)
Yo (Ah, ah, ah-ah)
Mmm (Mmm)
