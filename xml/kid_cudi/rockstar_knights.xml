[Intro: Kid Cudi & Trippie Redd]
I've been tellin' these niggas
Yeah, haha
Yee
Rock star life, dim the lights, baby, I don't wanna do this (Rock star life)
I'm all alone, fuck a song, I ain't worried 'bout nobody, I'm ruthless, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
'Til the end, in the end, I'ma be who I am
I ain't worried 'bout shit, goddamn
Built a whole empire in the city of the damned
I'm in a Bentley, seat reclined and they gon' see who I am
Seashore with a bad bitch, pretty feet in sand
Might eat her in the Aventador, The Silence of the Lambs
I remember payin' twenty for a damn gram
Now I can't leave the plug without a pound in my hand
Boy, we know you not a thug, without a doubt in my head
It be niggas that you love that'll run their mouth to the feds
Bro and them was trippin', they different off of the meds
From the trenches, catch you slippin', lil' nigga, poppin' your head

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
This is my life, so I gotta think ahead
Rock star life, thinkin' back, I could be dead
Demon in the night, baby, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinking 'bout me while you're layin' in your bed
This is my life, so I gotta think ahead
Rock star life, thinkin' back, I could be dead
Demon in the night, baby, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinking 'bout me while you're layin' in your bed
[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Two warriors, some soldiers (Uh-huh)
Trippie alley-oop, pull up, landed in the coupe (Oh yeah)
Niggas know the truth, far as you? Can't call it (Yeah)
Got a bunch of niggas say you fake, maskin' and ballin'
Realest motherfuckas, never cared about you suckas
Wish you'd get the bigger picture, legends out here never frontin', can't for'â€”
Can't forget me, baby, never
She say I'm too damn clever, how I handle, none better (None better)
The sheets gon' get wetter, coolin' out, a jet setter
Fuck the clout, see what I'm 'bout, all the real shit out my mouth
Can't have that fake shit around my area, none of that
Someone get these niggas, tell 'em it's over, I told ya
Life is 'bout survival, and no, see, you cannot fold, bruh
See, I don't really care, Backwood in the air
Catch me, baby, technicolor hair, how you do that there?
While these lames like to stop and stare, it's easy, man, I swear (Gone)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
This is my life, so I gotta think ahead
Rock star life, thinkin' back, I could be dead
Demon in the night, baby, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinking 'bout me while you're layin' in your bed
This is my life, so I gotta think ahead
Rock star life, thinkin' back, I could be dead
Demon in the night, baby, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinking 'bout me while you're layin' in your bed
[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Yeah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Yeah

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Handle in the whippa, hyper overdrive (Uh-huh)
Hands are out the roof, try and touch the sky (Woah)
And I'm yellin', "Do it," doin' how you like now
Say I'm cute and you ain't tellin' lies, nah
Tell 'em this the sequel to (Yeah)
All them days that I was faded, figured I was through
Hmm, seem the days ain't the same now
Hmm, catch a nigga dippin', baby, on a flight
Say he runnin', flippin' millions, servin' feelings
Watchin' for these fuckers, never see me slackin', slippin' (Yeah)
I'm on a trip, it's never endin' more than I realize (Yeah)
I cannot trip kissin' your lips, kissin' between your thighs
Ooh, run it back, I'm needin' all your energy (Damn)
It's the life, you see, it's really got a hold of me
Burn this smoke while I'm thinking, "Man, will I survive?"
Just a nigga livin' in hell, my mama know I tried

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Trippie Redd]
But we free, the lonely, lonely (Yeah, oh)
As we watch the sunset
My mind is meltin' (Oh)
A thousand blunts, can't OD, ooh, but I'm hoping
This my paradise, I fly (Oh)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
