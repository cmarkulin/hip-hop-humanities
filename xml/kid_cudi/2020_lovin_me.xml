        <line>Please, Lord, hear me now, hope you're listening</line>
        <line>It's been centuries, least what it seems to me</line>
        <line>I've been on this road, my eyes glistenin'</line>
        <line>As I stare at Scott, I know he's all I got</line>
        <line>Our pasts don't matter, babe, I'm much stronger</line>
        <line>And fly much farther, soar overseas</line>

        <line>At times I really didn't show</line>
        <line>What was wrong with me, wrong with me</line>
        <line>I told myself I cannot grow</line>
        <line>Without lovin' me, lovin' me</line>
        <line>But this is just the hell that lives inside, hmm</line>
        <line>Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide</line>

        <line>I've been goin', goin' in circles</line>
        <line>Reoccurring dreams, talkin' in my sleep</line>
        <line>Then I'm floatin' up to the surface</line>
        <line>I can finally breathe, I could do anything</line>
        <line>And I don't know why it's alright</line>
        <line>And it's not at the same time</line>
        <line>Then I look up at a blue sky</line>
        <line>And I know</line>
