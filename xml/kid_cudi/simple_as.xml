        <line>Uh, simple as that for your simple ass</line>
        <line>Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been</line>
        <line>They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig</line>
        <line>Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live</line>
        <line>I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive</line>

        <line>As our hero seems to be dreaming in peace</line>
        <line>A dark chapter unfolds</line>
        <line>Throwing Scott into the most eerie</line>
        <line>And unstable part of his imagination</line>
        <line>So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality</line>
        <line>This is the Rise of the Night Terrors</line>
