        <line>Uh, little homie, in the room</line>
        <line>In-in the room, boy on the moon</line>
        <line>(Had-had no-no one) No one to hang out with</line>
        <line>Talk that shit to just my little homies</line>
        <line>One year younger, they ain't get where I was going</line>
        <topic type="family"><line>Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)</line></topic>
        <line>Lonely in my room</line>
        <line>I-I mean me, up on the moon</line>
        <line>Entertained myself, laughed at myself</line>
        <line>As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself</line>
        <line>Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls</line>
        <line>Tried every sport just to impress all the girls</line>
        <line>Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down</line>
        <line>I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)</line>
        <line>(Ah-huh) And now my Facebook poppin'</line>
        <line>'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit</line>
        <line>One day</line>

        <line>Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move</line>
        <line>Made-made the move, flew off the moon</line>
        <line>Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with</line>
        <line>Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas</line>
        <line>All I would wonder is when will my time come</line>
        <line>Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them</line>
        <line>Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them</line>
        <line>Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them</line>
        <line>Nigga, I was late damn near every day</line>
        <line>But I'ma be on time when my stars align</line>
        <line>When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet</line>
        <line>Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders</line>
        <line>If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing</line>
        <line>Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream</line>
        <line>Until you meet a kid like K-I</line>
        <line>Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high</line>
        <line>We getting money, mom</line>
