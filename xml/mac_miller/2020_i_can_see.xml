<verse vocals="Mac_Miller" mood="hopeful" tone="positive">
<line>I'm so close I can taste it</line>
<line>The man on the moon keep playing</line>
<line>Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke</line>
<line>That I fade away in</line>
<line>You be complaining</line>
<line>And I can't explain it</line>
<line>I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling</line>
<line>The feeling amazing</line>
<line>Now I'm switchin' location</line>
<line>'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement</line>
<line>I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis</line>
<line>Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm</line>
<line>Before I drive myself crazy</line>

<chorus vocals="Mac_Miller" mood="determined" tone="neutral">
<line>And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we</line>
<line>Show me something, show me something, show me something</line>
<line>And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we</line>
<line>Show me something, show me something, something I can see</line>
</chorus>

<verse vocals="Mac_Miller" mood="determined" tone="positive">
<line>Yeah, don't tell me to stop</line>
<line>Let me keep goin' until I cannot</line>
<line>Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock</line>
<line>Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top</line>
<line>You never expect to drop, so hold on, but</line>
<topic type="religion"><line>That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one</line></topic>
<line>And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes</line>
<line>You got so far to go, but look at where you came from</line>
</verse>

<line>Show me something, show me something, something I can see</line>
