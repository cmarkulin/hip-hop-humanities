<line>Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall</line>
<line>I know nobody that knows where we're going at all</line>

<line>I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright</line>
<line>I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night</line>
<line>Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around</line>
<line>We'll take the stairs that gets us into there</line>
<line>It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but</line>
