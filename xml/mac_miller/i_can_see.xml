[Verse 1]
I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from
[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see
