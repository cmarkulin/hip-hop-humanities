<verse vocals="Mac Miller" mood="angry" tone="negative">
<line>Uh, look</line>
<line>They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor</line>
<line>You way too young and right now that's just human nature</line>
<line>You think you love her, but you don't</line>
<line>Think you gon' be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't</line>
<line>But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside</line>
<line>Used to be a player now I'm sidelined</line>
<line>Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tie-dye</line>
<line>She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila</line>
<line>It ain't a sexual thing though</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window</line></topic>
<line>In love with me now, she never huntin' me down</line>
<line>I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around</line>
<line>It's like a never-endin' chase, longer than a marathon</line>
<line>See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on</line>
<line>Uh, I know you love me don't lie <background>Don't lie</background></line>
<line>Uh, but you just gotta be mine, 'cause</line>

<line>Hey, hey, haha, look</line>
<line>I know this girl who want the world to call her own</line>
<line>Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone</line>
<line>And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home</line>
<line>Hit the road, forgettin' about everybody she know</line>
<line>Miss Hasn't Called Me In Four Days</line>
<line>But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay</line>
<line>Hey, she try and be a lil' player, think she cute too</line>
<line>But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth</line>
<line>When the boy blow, I know she worried <background>Know she worried</background></line>
<line>About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty <background>Actin' flirty</background></line>
<line>See that's the thing-thing, I don't give a fuck</line>
<line>I want your heart so baby give it up</line>
<line>In this life, girl, all we can do is try</line>
<line>Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I</line>
<line>We can travel 'round the world, movin' through the sky</line>
<line>Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine</line>
