<line>The wheels stay spinnin' on the Civic, boy, I'm always on the move</line>
<line>When you grindin' all the time, there's a lot of shit to do</line>
<line>That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine</line>
<line>I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee</line>
<line>Clean shoes, boy, new feet</line>
<line>And I'm never in the car with only two seats</line>
<line>I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep</line>
<line>Motherfucker, we the future like next week</line>
<line>Young people don't see you as an equal</line>
<line>They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool</line>
<line>You only gettin' one shot, no redo</line>
<line>Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue</line>
<line>Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?</line>
<line>I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss</line>
<line>Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift</line>
<line>Leave 'em in a daze, all like, "What day is it?"</line>
<line>Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge</line>
<line>Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits</line>
<line>They keep wantin' more, I'm their favorite dish</line>
<line>This me, motherfucker, I ain't changing shit</line>

<line>I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes</line>
<line>Leaving every single party with a brand new ho</line>
<line>Yeah, I've done a little travelin', circlin' the globe</line>
<line>Always keep it movin', inertia on these hoes</line>
<line>Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag</line>
<line>This some old-school shit, but no boom bap</line>
<line>This ain't new swag, it's the same old me</line>
<line>The youngin get respect from the game's OGs</line>
<line>Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key</line>
<topic type="money"><line>Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be</line></topic>
<line>On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E</line>
<line>With my head out the window screaming, "Get like me"</line>
<line>Ho, you should know the way I roll</line>
<line>Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes</line>
<line>You ain't nothin' with your wack rap</line>
<line>Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh</line>
