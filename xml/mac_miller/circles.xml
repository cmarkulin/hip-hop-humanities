<line>Well, this is what it look like right before you fall</line>
<line>Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction</line>
<line>Next step, you can't see at all</line>
<line>And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no</line>
<line>Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?</line>
<line>And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no</line>
<line>Trust me, I've tried</line>
<line>I just end up right at the start of the line</line>
<line>Drawin' circles</line>
<line>Mmm</line>
<line>Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine</line>
<line>We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline</line>
<line>And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm</line>
<line>Do not be afraid, do not be afraid</line>
<line>You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine</line>
<topic type="social issues"><line>Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time</line></topic>
<line>It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late</line>
<line>Damn, and I find</line>
<line>It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time</line>
<line>Drawin' circles</line>
