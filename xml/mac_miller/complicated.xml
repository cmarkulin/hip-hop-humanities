[Verse 1]
Outside is cloudy, but I like that better (Better, better)
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today

[Chorus]
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

[Verse 2]
And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy

[Verse 3]
Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered (Cluttered, cluttered)
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?

[Chorus]
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
[Outro]
Some people say they want to live forever
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
