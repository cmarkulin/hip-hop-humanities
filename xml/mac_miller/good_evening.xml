<verse vocals="Mac Miller" mood="apathetic" tone="negative">
<line>Takin' sips from the fountain of youth</line>
<line>If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop</line>
<line>As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes</line>
<line>See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside</line>
<line>I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind</line>
<line>Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride</line>
<line>Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry</line>
<line>There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy</line>
<line>Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion</line>
<line>Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't</line>
<line>They give a little love like everyone does</line>

<line>And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war</line>
<line>'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before</line>
<line>Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core</line>
<line>It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more</line>
