<line>I'm so close but they don't know</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow</line></topic>
<line>Rock the cleanest clothes</line>
<line>My life different from every single kid you know</line>
<line>Places I go out on my own</line>
<line>Hoes stay blowing up my phone</line>
<line>But, I wanna be left alone</line>
<line>Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row</line>

<line>Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?</line>
<line>I feel so fly and I hope you can relate</line>
<line>I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee</line>
<line>It's the same old dude but a brand new me</line>
<line>I've been up and I've been down</line>
<line>Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around</line>

<line>They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried</line>
<line>But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside</line>
<line>I'm just trying to make some music for the ride</line>
<line>Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive</line>
<line>Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind</line>
<line>Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time</line>
<line>I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine</line>
<line>Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter</line>
<line>I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag</line>
<topic type="family"><line>Mom says, "You could see my ass" and she laughed</line></topic>
<line>Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash</line>
<topic type="drugs"><line>Stashing the weed under the passenger seat</line></topic>
<line>Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me</line>

<line>And now you know how we felt <background>Aha</background></line>
