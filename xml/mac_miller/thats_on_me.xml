[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1]
Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up, I'll help you get around

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Bridge]
I'll let it go
I'll cut the strings
Today I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but
[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know
