[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a while without your face
But I saw your picture on the wall the other day
Too much distance, too much space
You need to come back home or run along, yeah
I'm waitin' for the light to change
You ask me how I've been, well I'm good, I can't complain
Times get harder, things get strained
All I know, I don't want you gone

[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby
And you know I hate to keep you waitin'
But when it's right, then it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
Love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin', yeah
It ain't always great, but it's never borin', yeah

[Verse 2]
And I been itchin' for your love
Don't want to feel a single thing if it ain't your touch
I get drunk and become numb
Just want to stumble into us
But baby, don't stop now 'cause it ain't over, yeah
Few years ago I was so dumb
Clueless, young and stupid, but look at who I have become
I ain't gonna break your heart, promise it's always safe
Baby, don't go now, pull me closer
[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby (Woah)
You know I hate to keep you waitin'
But I know when it's right, then it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
'Cause love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin'
It ain't always great, but it's never borin'

[Outro]
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (Ha-ha)
But when it's right, then it's right, alright
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhm
