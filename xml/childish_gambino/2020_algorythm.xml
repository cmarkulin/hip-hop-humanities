        <line>Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets</line>
        <line>Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete</line>
        <line>What was the motivation? Constant communication</line>
        <line>Everybody wanna get chose like Moses</line>
        <line>Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses</line>
        <line>Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient</line>
        <line>Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission</line>
        <line>Told it to call a friend, didn't tell it to listen</line>
        <line>So very scary, so binary, zero or one</line>
        <line>Like or dislike, coal mine canary</line>
        <line>I dream in color, not black and white</line>
        <line>You sell your daughter on that data stream</line>
        <line>Dopamine make it hit now</line>
        <line>Humans don't understand, humans gon' sell a lie</line>
        <line>Humans gotta survive, we know we gon' die</line>
        <line>Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try</line>
        <line>Life, is it really worth it? The algorhythm is perfect, mmh</line>
