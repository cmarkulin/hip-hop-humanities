    <outro vocals="Childish Gambino" mood="hopeful" tone="positive">
        <line>This is on a bus back from camp</line>
        <line>I'm thirteen and so are you</line>
        <line>Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes</line>
        <line>I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble</line>
        <line>It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you</line>
        <line>And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus</line>
        <line>And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us</line>
        <line>We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles</line>
        <line>I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you</line>
        <line>But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me</line>
        <line>You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer</line>
        <line>Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me</line>
        <line>And choosing to do so again the next day and so on</line>
        <line>A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh</line>
        <line>Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh</line>
        <line>But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be</line>
        <line>A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her</line>
        <line>Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it</line>
        <line>From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet</line>
        <line>Back in the real world we don't go to the same school</line>
        <line>And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood</line>
        <line>We won't go to the same high school</line>
        <line>So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something</line>
        <line>And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something</line>
        <line>The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep</line>
        <line>We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop</line>
        <line>That looks like a kid we know</line>
        <line>And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?”</line>
        <line>And all of a sudden I'm telling you</line>
        <line>And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming</line>
        <line>And your face is there and gone and there and gone</line>
        <line>As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway</line>
        <line>And there's no expression on it</line>
        <line>And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time</line>
        <line>Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet</line>
        <line>And regrettably, I end up using the word “destiny”</line>
        <line>I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter</line>
        <line>Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”</line>
        <line>I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive</line>
        <line>And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment</line>
        <line>But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus</line>
        <line>So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am</line>
        <line>I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore</line>
        <line>The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on</line>
        <line>I turn and you're not there</line>
        <line>Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore</line>
        <line>We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist
            church</line>
        <line>The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now</line>
        <line>Your bags and things piled high in the trunk</line>
        <line>The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet
            time</line>
        <line>Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus</line>
        <line>Just as one of them reaches my row</line>
        <line>It used to be our row, on our way off</line>
        <line>It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week</line>
        <line>After throwing rocks at my head</line>
        <line>Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise</line>
        <line>She stops and looks down at me</line>
        <line>And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her
            face</line>
        <line>But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”</line>
        <line>Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh</line>
        <line>And then she turns and leads them off the bus</line>
        <line>I didn't know you were friends with them</line>
        <line>I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is
            over</line>
        <line>So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts</line>
        <line>This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad</line>
        <line>This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or
            not</line>
        <line>I'm just saying it's what I learned</line>
        <line>I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody</line>
        <line>So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always</line>
        <line>Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told
            them</line>
        <line>But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you</line>
        <line>Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose</line>
        <line>I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy</line>
        <line>And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit</line>
        <line>But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the
            bus</line>
        <line>I still haven't</line>
