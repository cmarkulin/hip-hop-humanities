# Conclusions for Mac Miller J Cole and Kendrick Lamar
---

## Mac Miller

At the start of his career, it appears that Mac Miller sang about more positive elements
within his songs, as the tone graphs show an almost 50% total for positive. In terms of
topics during his early album, it seems that he sang more-so about social issues than any other
topics on our list. Looking forward to his most recent album, Mac Miller seems to have switched
from a more positive tone to one that is more negative, as negative totals in at about 75%, making
sense as he had died from a drug overdose in the midist of recording. Looking
at topics, he refrences money in his songs more than anything, which is no suprise as overtime
with fame, many will "crave" money. Overall, it can be concluded that at the start of his career,
Mac Miller was speaking about our chosen topics in a more positive manner, but near the end became more "sad," and 
more negative, which most likely pointed to his death. 


## Kendrick Lamar

In terms of his older album that we chose, it appears that negative tones are more common, with the talk of topics money and violence being the higest.
Then however, looking at the tone graphs for Kendrick Lamar's most recent album that we chose, there is no
clear leader, although negative seems to pull ahead a bit, they are all dispersed pretty evenly, allowing us to conclude that this album had "mixed emotions."
However, when looking at the topics, he seemed to speak a lot more about money, although not as much as the other album, and violence. 
These two topics are common in hip-hop songs, so it is no suprise that although with no clear leader in tone, these two topics showed the most in his most recent.
From these results we cam conclude that in the beginning of his career, Kendrick was singing about money in violence in a more negative way, but then in more recent times
has evened out, still speaking of the same topics, just now in a different manner.

## J Cole

Looking at the tone graphs for his first album that we chose, it appears that Cole's songs had a more positive tone, with it reaching a total of 50%. The topic graph shows him mainly 
speaking about money, most likely in a more positive sense, based on the tone graph for that year. When looking at the tone graph for the more recent album, clearly, this album
is one that is very negative, as negative tones show up 100% of the time throughout this album. With this in mind, it is no suprise that "death" was the most common
topic that was refrenced througout this album. Overall, based on our graphs and final data, it can be concluded that Cole started singing about more positive topics, specifically money in 
a more positive manner, to then switching to entirely negative tone singing about heavy topics such as death and violence.
