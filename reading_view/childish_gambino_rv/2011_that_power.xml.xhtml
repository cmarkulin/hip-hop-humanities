            <p>All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though</p>

         <h2>Mood: HOPEFUL</h2>
         <div class="positive">
            
            <p>This is on a bus back from camp</p>
            
            <p>I'm thirteen and so are you</p>
            
            <p>Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes</p>
            
            <p>I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble</p>
            
            <p>It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you</p>
            
            <p>And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus</p>
            
            <p>And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us</p>
            
            <p>We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles</p>
            
            <p>I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you</p>
            
            <p>But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me</p>
            
            <p>You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer</p>
            
            <p>Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me</p>
            
            <p>And choosing to do so again the next day and so on</p>
            
            <p>A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh</p>
            
            <p>Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh</p>
            
            <p>But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be</p>
            
            <p>A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her</p>
            
            <p>Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it</p>
            
            <p>From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet</p>
            
            <p>Back in the real world we don't go to the same school</p>
            
            <p>And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood</p>
            
            <p>We won't go to the same high school</p>
            
            <p>So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something</p>
            
            <p>And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something</p>
            
            <p>The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep</p>
            
            <p>We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop</p>
            
            <p>That looks like a kid we know</p>
            
            <p>And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?”</p>
            
            <p>And all of a sudden I'm telling you</p>
            
            <p>And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming</p>
            
            <p>And your face is there and gone and there and gone</p>
            
            <p>As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway</p>
            
            <p>And there's no expression on it</p>
            
            <p>And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time</p>
            
            <p>Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet</p>
            
            <p>And regrettably, I end up using the word “destiny”</p>
            
            <p>I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter</p>
            
            <p>Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”</p>
            
            <p>I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive</p>
            
            <p>And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment</p>
            
            <p>But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus</p>
            
            <p>So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am</p>
            
            <p>I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore</p>
            
            <p>The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on</p>
            
            <p>I turn and you're not there</p>
            
            <p>Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore</p>
            
            <p>We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist
               church</p>
            
            <p>The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now</p>
            
            <p>Your bags and things piled high in the trunk</p>
            
            <p>The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet
               time</p>
            
            <p>Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus</p>
            
            <p>Just as one of them reaches my row</p>
            
            <p>It used to be our row, on our way off</p>
            
            <p>It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week</p>
            
            <p>After throwing rocks at my head</p>
            
            <p>Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise</p>
            
            <p>She stops and looks down at me</p>
            
            <p>And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her
               face</p>
            
            <p>But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”</p>
            
            <p>Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh</p>
            
            <p>And then she turns and leads them off the bus</p>
            
            <p>I didn't know you were friends with them</p>
            
            <p>I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is
               over</p>
            
            <p>So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts</p>
            
            <p>This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad</p>
            
            <p>This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true
               or
               not</p>
            
            <p>I'm just saying it's what I learned</p>
            
            <p>I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody</p>
            
            <p>So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always</p>
            
            <p>Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told
               them</p>
            
            <p>But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you</p>
            
            <p>Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose</p>
            
            <p>I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy</p>
            
            <p>And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit</p>
            
            <p>But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the
               bus</p>
            
            <p>I still haven't</p>
