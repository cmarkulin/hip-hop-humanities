            <p>I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all</p>
            
            <p>I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want</p>
            
            <div class="poverty">
               
               <p>I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt</p>
               
               <p>Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut</p>
               
               <p>My dad works nights, putting on a stone face</p>
               
               <p>He's saving up so we can get our own place</p>
               
               <p>In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me</p>
               </div>
            
            <p>They called me "fat nose," my mom say, "You handsome to me"</p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced</p>
            
            <p>But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants</p>
            
            <p>And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out</p>
            
            <p>They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about</p>
            
            <p>Cause hood shit and black shit is super different</p>
            
            <p>So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition</p>
            
            <p>Mom and dad wouldn't listen</p>
            
            <p>They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that</p>
            
            <p>All their friends in NY deal crack</p>
            
            <p>It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em</p>
            
            <p>But when you leave the hood</p>
            
            <p>They think that you look down on 'em</p>
            
            <p>The truth is we still struggle on a different plane</p>
            
            <div class="poverty">
               
               <p>7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same</p>
               </div>
            
            <p>Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit</p>
            
            <p>But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"</p>
            </div>
