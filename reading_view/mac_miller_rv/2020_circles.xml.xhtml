            <p>Well, this is what it look like right before you fall</p>
            
            <p>Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction</p>
            
            <p>Next step, you can't see at all</p>
            
            <p>And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no</p>
            
            <p>Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?</p>

            <p>Mmm</p>
            
            <p>Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine</p>
            
            <p>We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline</p>
            
            <p>And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm</p>
