               <p>But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid</p>
               
               <p>It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved</p>

            <p>We are all here for a reason on a particular path</p>
            
            <p>You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math</p>
            
            <p>Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious</p>
            
            <p>That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world</p>
            
            <p>I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls</p>
            
            <p>I'm not just another individual</p>
            
            <p>My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual</p>
            
            <p>But I get my hymns from Him</p>
            
            <p>So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical</p>
            
            <p>I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument</p>
            
            <p>My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes</p>
            
            <p>For your soul and your mental</p>
            
            <p>That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into</p>
            
            <p>Yeah I need my loot by rent day</p>
            
            <p>But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte</p>
            
            <p>I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque</p>
            
            <p>I can't stop, that's why I'm hot</p>
            
            <p>Determination, dedication, motivation</p>
            
            <p>I'm talking to you of my many inspirations</p>
            
            <p>When I say I can't let you or self-down</p>
            
            <p>If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff</p>
            
            <p>And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life</p>
            
            <p>In my grip, I would never ever let you down</p>
            
            <p>And when these words are found</p>
            
            <p>Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed</p>
            
            <p>With a language called love</p>
            
            <p>That's why my breath is felt by the deaf</p>
            
            <p>And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind</p>
            
            <p>I too dream in color and in rhyme</p>
            
            <p>So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house</p>
            
            <p>'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth</p>
            
            <p>A touch of God reigns out</p>
