         <div class="negative">
            
            <p>"I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe
               in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime.
               That's what I believe in not believing in."</p>
            
            <p>"So what keeps you alive?"</p>
            
            <div class="death">
               <p>"Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what
                  keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that
                  keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times.
                  And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go</p>
            
            <p>Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever</p>
            
            <p>It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts</p>
            
            <p>And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect</p>
            
            <div class="religion">
               <p>I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>You should either hear me now or go deaf</p>
            
            <div class="death">
               <p>Or end up dead, die trying and know death</p>

            <div class="death">
               <p>Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga</p>
            
            <p>I mean that from the bottom of my heart</p>
            
            <p>You see my art is all I have</p>
            
            <p>And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt</p>
            
            <p>Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car</p>
            
            <p>Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from</p>
            
            <p>We buy guns and more guns to give to the young</p>
            
            <p>I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga</p>
            
            <p>Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas</p>
            
            <p>My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight</p>
            
            <p>He told me "Rap about life, not rap niggas"</p>
            
            <p>That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'</p>
            
            <p>My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching</p>
            
            <p>I start evaluating, then my final intuition</p>
            
            <p>Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up</p>
            
            <p>We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse</p>
            
            <p>Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre</p>
            
            <p>And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph</p>
            
            <p>Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance</p>
            
            <p>Put burners in the hands of the black man</p>
            
            <p>One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant</p>
            
            <p>You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am</p>
            
            <div class="religion">
               <p>You probably even listened to "Faith," and think I know Zion</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth</p>
            
            <p>Because it seem like it's always clashing with science</p>
            
            <p>I got a big fear of flying</p>
            
            <p>My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice</p>
            
            <p>I ain't lying</p>
            
            <p>I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick</p>

            <p>You just mind your business</p>
            
            <p>You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis</p>
            
            <p>It's kind of scary, ain't it?</p>
            
            <p>You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous</p>

            <p>I promise to keep it honest</p>
            
            <p>Secret society, all we ask is trust</p>
            
            <p>And all we lack is communication like service sucks</p>
            
            <p>The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come</p>
