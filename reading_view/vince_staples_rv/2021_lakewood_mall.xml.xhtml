         <div class="null">
            
            <p>Nigga met this nigga at the McDonald's at Lakewood Mall</p>
            
            <p>This nigga like, randomly, like, "Bro, I got the Blue L.A.'s for your .38 Derringer"</p>
            
            <p>Mind you nigga, this a— this a— you feel me?</p>
            
            <p>It's the little pearl hammer handle thing, in and out</p>
            
            <p>Nigga give it to him</p>
            
            <p>Later on that night, nigga get pulled over</p>
            
            <p>Police thoroughly searched the car</p>
            
            <p>On God, nigga would've got cracked if I would've kept it</p>
            
            <p>And they never even knew I got rid of the gun</p>
            
            <p>I never told 'em, so the whole time they sеarching, everybody in the car is scarеd</p>
            
            <p>I forgot to tell 'em, like, "Nigga been gave that shit away"</p>
            
            <p>Then niggas go to this lil' party</p>
            
            <p>Whatever the case, niggas like, "Fuck it, we ain't got nothin' to do, we gon' go"</p>
            
            <p>Mind you, niggas ain't had shit to do all day</p>
            
            <p>Niggas be getting robbed and some more shit, it's— it's wild</p>
            
            <p>Vince like, "Nah, I'm cool"</p>
            
            <p>Niggas go shake, go home</p>
            
            <p>Later on that night, the homies, they get booked</p>
            
            <p>Two bodies. Crazy—allegedly, though. Free Ty Bud</p>
            
            <p>Moral of this whole story: Nigga gotta think ahead, which a nigga always has</p>
            
            <p>You gotta separate yourself from bullshit (My world filled blue)</p>
            
            <p>Can't get wrapped up in it (My life is blue)</p>
            
            <p>And once again, it's still "Free Pac Slimm" 'til they free Pac Slimm</p>
